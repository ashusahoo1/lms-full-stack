# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



<!-- 

1: in lms project here we wont be making different frontend for educator it will both run in same api so we need to make 2 component one for student and one for eduactor

2: after making component structure make context file in context folder

ie:A Context Provider in React (or other libraries that use a similar pattern) is used to share data globally across a component tree without prop drilling (i.e., without passing props manually through every level of nested components).

3: now wrap everything with browseroruter 

4: set up the routes in app.jsx

5: to use educator and student both one need to be normal route and another needs to be outlet and remove slash from normal routes
